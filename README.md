# syllabusscraper

A Google API based Python script which scrapes a teacher's syllabus and outputs it into a text file. I currently use this .txt file with a program called Rainmeter which allows displaying widgets on the desktop in Windows. Currently, this is setup to scrape 1 syllabus (Mrs. Hylton's AP Psychology). Due to the different syllabus formats for each teacher, I will need to continue writing different code to scrape each of my teachers' syllabi.
